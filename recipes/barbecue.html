    <p>Homemade rib marinade is used in this barbecue ribs recipe that's easier than it looks. I usually cook the ribs the day before and grill them for a quick dinner the next night. The sauce is much better after it is cooked; it is not a dipping sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds pork spareribs</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chile sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rum</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>1 dash ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
