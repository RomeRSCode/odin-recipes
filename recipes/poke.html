    <h1>Ahi Tuna Poke</h1>
    <img src="../images/poke.jpg" alt="poke" width="600">
    <p>This easy poke recipe is a refreshing Hawaiian salad of fresh ahi tuna steak cubes tossed with soy sauce, sesame oil, and green onions for a dish full of umami flavor. I like to add chopped macadamia nuts even though they are not authentic - they add a delicious crunch. This makes 4 main course servings or 8 appetizer servings.</p>
    <h2>What is Poke?</h2>
    <p>Poke is a Hawaiian dish. Its name derives from the Hawaiian work "to slice or cut". The name is a good indicator of what the dish is because poke is traditionally sliced raw fish (usually tuna or octopus) that's marinated in a savory, umami-rich sauce made with soy sauce, sesame oil, and green onions.</p>
    <p>Poke can be eaten as is, but it's typically served in a poke bowl with other ingredients like rice, vegetables, and hot sauce.</p>
